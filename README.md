This Android app contains a handful of nifty tools that you can use to keep track of your thoughts and findings, or even to get inspiration from, for the more creative types out there.

## Journal 
Everyday, should you decide to open the app, you'll be greeted with your journal, which holds your notes, alongside a brand new daily space photo for inspiration. And guess what? These photos? They come *straight* from the NASA Astronomy Pic of the Day API <sup>*(ooh)*</sup>.

You can use the journal's notes to write down, for example, spacey, vast poetry, or use it to log celestial objects you've located and thoughts you have on them.
Please keep in mind that the notes you write will be stored in your phone's local database, so, you if you decide to uninstall the app, you will lose them.

## Weather
I'm sure you know what your local weather. Every weather app does the same thing, so it's pretty hard to squeeze your way into the market on the app store. Buuuut, how many apps give your the ability to see...

### MARTIAN WEATHER?

That's right ladies and gentlemen, this fantastic app will let you check in on what the weather's like on our red neighbor to the... out? Hmm.

Similar to the Pic of the Day, it is built on a NASA API, this one being the InSight API. You should note that a martian day, known as a Sol, is slightly longer than an earth day. This app will report to you data per Sol, so it won't necessarily sync up to Earth days. This screen will display available information about weather for the current Sol. **NOTE: The temperature and wind direction services for the InSight API are temporarily suspended.** In the meantime, we will display all other information available, including the daily average atmospheric pressure, and what season Mars is currently experiencing.

## Word Generator

One of the worst things to happen to you as a creator is writer's block. To help you overcome this trouble, we, as a creative writing app, decided to implement a (drumroll please) _**Random Word Generator**_! This generator will default to space-themed words, though you can change that. Push the _Big Bang!_ button to get started.

## Settings

Finally, we get down to the nitty-gritty. This small, but necessary, tab will allow you to tailor your experience with the app and provide you with helpful links. From here you can also access the credits page.
